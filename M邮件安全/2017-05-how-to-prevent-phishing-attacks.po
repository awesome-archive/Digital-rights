"A typical way of getting hacked is falling for a phishing attack. In fact, "
"most of the large data breaches in recent years have been due to phishing."

"The number of phishing attacks is increasing because they are both easy to "
"execute and highly effective. Even if the eventual goal of an attacker is an "
"organization, attacks always begin by targeting individuals. Phishing "
"attacks have been utilized to steal confidential information, compromise "
"entire organizations, and perhaps even influence a Presidential election.\n"
"What is a phishing attack?"

"Phishing is a type of online attack where criminals send a fake email asking "
"you to click a link or download an attachment, appearing to be from a "
"legitimate source. That can be a bank, a credit card company, an email "
"provider or popular services like Google, Ebay, or Facebook."

msgid ""
"Phishing campaigns can be extremely sophisticated, making use of highly "
"personalized messages that appear to come from people you know, or companies "
"you trust. Oftentimes, attackers will try to trick you into entering your "
"password into a web page that appears legitimate but is actually a "
"fraudulent site which is stealing your data."
msgstr ""

#: 2017-05-how-to-prevent-phishing-attacks.txt:16
msgid ""
"Phishing attacks can also rely on malicious software. Instead of trying to "
"trick you into entering your password, these attacks will try to trick you "
"into clicking on a link to an infected website, or opening an infected file, "
"or installing malicious software on your device. For example, an attacker "
"pretending to be your bank might ask you to review recent transactions and "
"send over a file of recent transactions. However, opening the file will "
"install a virus on your computer.\n"

"Fortunately, it’s not difficult to defend against phishing attacks as long "
"as you are vigilant and comply with the following rules. These rules are "
"generally applicable and aren’t specific to ProtonMail. But as you will see "
"below, ProtonMail has several additional anti-phishing protections built in, "
"which make it much harder to become a victim.\n"
"Protect your email address"
msgstr ""

#: 2017-05-how-to-prevent-phishing-attacks.txt:21
msgid ""
"In order to start an attack against you, attackers must first know your "
"email address. You can’t hide your address, however, you can keep separate "
"email addresses for different purposes. For example, don’t use your business "
"card email address for your bank account, loan or other sensitive accounts. "
"Choose a secure, secret one."

"With ProtonMail you can use multiple addresses to keep your private address "
"a secret. For example, if the address you use in public is john.doe@"
"protonmail.com, you can create a second address john1988@protonmail.com to "
"use only for sensitive accounts like online banking. Thus, if somebody "
"pretending to be your bank sends you an email to john.doe@protonmail.com, "
"you can identify it as a phishing email because it was not sent to the "
"address you use for your online banking.\n"

"    the sender of the email will usually not be an official communication "
"account. For example, a phishing email targeting ProtonMail users might be "
"sent from timothy.bad@mail.ru\n"
"    the link contained in the phishing email will also not be an official "
"site either. For example, the link in the email might go to protonrnai1.com "
"instead of protonmail.com. ProtonMail offers a link confirmation feature "
"that can help you verify the link you are following is not malicious.\n"
"    emails can also come from people that you know, but with subtle "
