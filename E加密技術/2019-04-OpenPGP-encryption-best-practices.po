"Strong encryption is no longer a privilege of geeks and paranoids, but is "
"becoming mainstream. However, true end-to-end encryption is not out-of-the-"
"box and generally requires you to activate a number of switches as described "
"in this post about Instant Messaging.  OpenPGP encryption is no exception "
"and requires that a few good practices are followed by the users for it to "
"be at its most secure. This blogpost will provide you with a concise list of "

"If you don’t update the public keys in your key store, then you do not get "

"You can deniably exchange keys by having an easily available and "
"identifiable public key. Tell all correspondents to use your public key to "
"contact you and include their public key in the encrypted body of the "
"message. This will protect you from all mainstream key-exchange attacks. "
"Just ensure that your public is verifiable through multiple channels, for "
"example: social media, public mailing lists, key servers, etc. The more "

#: 2019-04-OpenPGP-encryption-best-practices.txt:49
msgid ""
"Users generally don’t want their keys to expire, but there are good reasons "
"to let them. Why? The point is to setup something that disables your key in "
"case you lose access to it or if it has been compromised (and you have no "
"revocation certificate).  You can always extend your expiration date, even "
"after it has expired! This “expiration” is actually more of a safety valve "

msgid ""
"In case you forget your passphrase or if your private key is compromised or "
"lost, the only hope you have is to wait for the key to expire (this is not a "
"good solution). A better approach is to activate your revocation certificate "
"by publishing it on Public key servers. Doing this will notify others that "
"this key has been revoked."
msgstr ""

#: 2019-04-OpenPGP-encryption-best-practices.txt:61

msgid ""
"Most OpenPGP based applications come with a single, specific key server. "
"This is not ideal because if the key server fails, or even worse, if it "
"appears to work but is not functioning properly, you may not receive "
"critical key updates. Not only is this a single point of failure, it is also "
"a prime source of leaks of relationship information between OpenPGP users, "
"and thus a target for attacks."
msgstr ""

#: 2019-04-OpenPGP-encryption-best-practices.txt:86
msgid ""
"Therefore, it is good not to base yourself on only one public key server for "
"publishing or importing keys. Mailfence uses sks keyservers pool – a pool of "
"servers having regular health checks to ensure that they are functioning "
"properly. If a server is not working well, it will be removed automatically "
"from the pool."
msgstr ""

#: 2019-04-OpenPGP-encryption-best-practices.txt:88

"Finally, all your interactions with the keyserver should be encrypted (over "

"Minimizing the contextual information leakage from the communication is also "
"a good practice by simply hiding the meta-data (to, from, ip address, etc). "
"Where possible, and relevant, take control over that infomation and unlink "
"it from data linked to you. For example, you can control the From field by "
"creating a new email account. The IP address of the sending email client can "
"be changed by using a VPN, Tor, or a public Internet connection. The usual "
"caveats about Tor apply: do not rely exclusively on Tor, if you need to "
"protect your IP address then use an IP address that is not attributable to "
