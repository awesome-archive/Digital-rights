"Certain events have led to renewed calls from governments and law "
"enforcement for more sophisticated tools for monitoring suspects. One idea "
"that has received renewed attention is ‘encryption backdoors.’ An encryption "
"backdoor is a method of getting around encryption or authentication in a "
"system."

"Backdoors can exist for legitimate, practical reasons. An example is "
"allowing a manufacturer or service provider to restore access to a user who "
"has forgotten their password. However, encryption backdoors allow parties "
"like governments or spy agencies to bypass normal security measures. This "
"happens in order to gain access to an account or device and its data. "
"Essentially, these are ways for the manufacturer to allow certain parties "
"access to parts of a device. On the other hand, robust encryption methods "
"protects these parts of the device. A simple possible analogy is having a "
"very expensive, difficult to pick lock on your front door that only you "
"know. In comparison of hiding your house key under a potted plant (that "
"presumably only very limited parties are aware of)."

"The backdoor encryption is a concept that could be hard to comprehend "
"without the actual encryption history. The concept of encryption itself is "
"thousands of years old. Ancient civilizations in Mesopotamia and the Levant "
"used simple methods of alphabetic substitution to encode sensitive "
"information. In the 19th century, the poet Edgar Allen Poe was a keen "
"amateur cryptographer. At that time he demonstrated his ability to decipher "
"encoded messages submitted to him by the public. Any study of the Second "
"World War must mention the decisive effects of breaking the German Enigma "
"codes. The success of pioneering computer scientist Alan Turing and his many "
"colleagues at Bletchley Park, 50 miles north-west of London, shortened the "
"war by at least two years. More recently, the invention of the computer and "
"the internet has led to more advanced methods of encryption.\n"

"Modern encryption consists of two components: public and private keys. When "
"a user sends a message to another, the sender’s computer uses the receiver’s "
"public key to encrypt the contents of the message. This encrypted message "
"will decrypt into its original state by using the receiver’s the private "
"key. A system that utilizes end-to-end encryption, like Mailfence, uses a "
"public key system, OpenPGP to be exact.  Alongside of OpenPGP based end-to-"
"end encryption, it also supports secure message escrow, or simply password "
"based end-to-end encrypted messages."

"The product of two prime numbers create a public key (in case of RSA "
"algorithm).  The two prime numbers that generate the public key, make up the "
"private key. Due to the mathematical complexity of finding the prime factors "
"of a large number, private keys could take decades to decrypt using a brute "
"force attack. Conversely, knowledge of a private key would mean that the "
"public key could be calculated in a split second. This as a result of it’s "
"simple multiplication. Therefore, it is strictly important to keep the "
"private keys hidden. Private keys are very difficult to crack. Therefore, "
"the only practical way of gaining unauthorized access to encrypted data, is "
"to obtain the private key itself. In order to access that private key, "
"encryption backdoor concept kicks in.\n"

"Encryption backdoors are implemented in the design and manufacture stage of "
"devices or software. They serve as a way to access these private keys. "
"Proponents of encryption backdoors support allowing limited access to "
"parties such as law enforcement. The mass shooting in San Bernardino, "
"California in December 2015 thrust this issue into the spotlight. Police "
"recovered the iPhone of one of the shooters. However, due to its passcode "
"was not possible to access the device. Initially, law enforcement "
"unsuccessfully requested Apple executives to grant exceptional access to the "
"device. The government then filed a court order to compel Apple to install "
"an encryption backdoor in a new version of the operating system so it could "
"then be loaded onto the device. Apple CEO Tim Cook rejected these calls, "
"saying that this demand had “implications far beyond the legal case at hand.”"

"If such an encryption backdoor were available, there is some debate as to "
"its effectiveness. Former Microsoft CTO Ray Ozzie proposed an idea to allow "
"law enforcement access to a ‘secure’ database of private keys, commonly "
"referred to as a key escrow system. The police can access the encrypted "
"device by using the private key. However, the device would then enter a "
"irreversible recovery mode and couldn’t be used again. However, as others "
"have pointed out, this system wouldn’t work because there wouldn’t be a way "
"to guarantee the security of the database containing backdoor keys.\n"

"The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital privacy advocacy group, argues "
"that there is no middle ground when it comes to encryption backdoors. They "
"argue that exceptional access “erodes encryption security, granting law "
"enforcement either its own set of private keys for every encrypted device "
"and individual who sends and receives encrypted messages,” or requires the "
"creation and secure storage of duplicate keys” that can be handed over by "
"the service provider upon request. The middle ground demanded by law "
"enforcement between ‘good’ and ‘bad’ encryption is still bad encryption.\n"

"The FBI’s failed request to get Apple to grant an encryption backdoor was "
"arguably an attempt at setting a legal precedent. If Apple had acquiesced to "
"this demand, there would be a legal precedent. As a result, it would create "
"additional encryption backdoors in the future. Creating encryption backdoors "
"from manufactures in emergency cases like this leads into consequences. As a "
"result, all kinds of devices would immediately be at greater risk of attack "
"from criminals and other bad actors.\n"

"As our lives increasingly rely on technology, the potential consequences of "
"encryption backdoors only worsen. With the emergence of the Internet of "
"Things, the existence of an encryption backdoor in one device could "
"jeopardize security of other devices connected to it. As the saying goes, a "
"chain is only as strong as its weakest link. Bad actors could compromise a "
"seemingly innocuous IoT appliance. Therefore, this will put much more "
"critical devices and data at risk of compromise. When we consider the large "
"amount stored of our personal data on our devices and cloud services, the "
"potential for abuse from repressive governments becomes more clear.\n"

"A hot debate about encryption backdoors has been going on for decades. In "
"one camp are cryptography experts and privacy advocates fiercely defending "
"the need to maintain strict encryption standards and practices. On the other "
"side, governments and law enforcement agencies maintain a strong interest in "
"establishing encryption backdoors in the name of public safety. Regarding "
